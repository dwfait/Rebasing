# Git Rebasing Tutorial

A short tutorial for Alliants on basic interactive rebasing usage, and the common issues you may run into.

Each numbered branch (in the format n-branch-name) contains a problem you can solve with git rebase --interactive.

3-log-in-repo however can not be solved with a rebase interactive, and instead needs a filter branch to completely remove the log file from the repository.

Fork this repo and have a play around!
